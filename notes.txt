So in this lesson I went over forms and Learned a few things. 
SO to begin he made a variable with the regular expression I've been learning lately
If you need a refresher look up his playlist or go to regex101
So he constructed a regex with the functionality of a password and placed it inside an attribute
As you can see the regex is housed in a syntax of "placeholder": 
this syntax is going to be used to link to an attribute, in this case a name attribute 
after getting that ground work set he created a varibale that could select the elements he needed to 
alter, since its a form this element was a "input" element he selected all of them because choosing a singular 
element gets a error. Despite this you can still alter each input element in different ways. 
He did this by creating a arrow function from the inputs variable he just made 
this function was a for each (get a refresher if needed), essential each input element would excute a given function
this given function was to listen for a certain event a 'keyup' (basically when someone types).
It gets meta after this though so inside this function that listens for a key type there is another function inside (nested)
this function is linkd to a parameter e that I don't fully understand yet, but through this parameter
the function was able to link an value from the html by writing the path essential starting with target then to 
the desired destination of a input value, So he first console logged this to see if it worked, 
he checked that the overally function of looking for a keyup working and as you typed JS was logging how many key times 
where made and which input name they where made in, having accomplished this the function wasn't done yet 
He created a second function named validate that he was going to use to link the regex function with the key listener function
this function was gonna link them together so he created two parameters that where gonna be used as placeholders for the functions
in this linking function named validate he made a if statement that would apply a class Name of valid or invalid 
with a if condition that would test the regex for the given input and see if the key stroke value satisfies the expression
after creating this function he wrote it inside the inputs foreach function and inputed the parameter format.
